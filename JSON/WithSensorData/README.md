# EPCIS event data with sensorElementList in JSON / JSON-LD format

This directory has eight example files in JSON / JSON-LD  (JSON-LD with most of the  weirdness hidden in the @context header, which will eventually be remotely referenced from gs1.org)
These are intended to correspond to the XML examples in the [SensorDataExamples.xml](../XSD/SensorDataExamples.xm) file.

It does not yet contain JSON Schema or SHACL validation files with validation extended to support the new v2.0 sensor data features 
- but these are under development and will be added here soon.
